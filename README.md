# codingtest
This code base is to test Payments BRE module

Please use the PaymentsBREUnitTest.cs file to run the Unit test cases with Visual Studio
Please use the Program.cs file to run the program to see the demo on console with Visual Studio

Not sure below 2 cases:
If the payment is for a membership or upgrade, email the owner and inform them of the activation/upgrade
If the payment is for a physical product or a book, generate a commission payment to the agent

As these 2 cases will by default fall under the individual cases 
If the payment is for a physical product 
If the payment is for a book
and 
If the payment is for a membership
If the payment is an upgrade

Need clarification for this to clearly implement, as of now these 2 cases are treated as 2 different scenarios and given case statement exclusively
